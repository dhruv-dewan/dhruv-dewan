👋 Hey There!

- 🗣️ My name is Dhruv Dewan 

- 🌱 I enjoy venturing deep behind the stage curtain of AI/ML and creating practical and novel solutions. I love to learn about mathematical concepts within ML and finance, and I love to backpack up large hills ⛰️.

- 🧮 Currently, I am working on creating and design LLM powered applications involving agentic workflows. I am heavily invested in reseaeching and learning about LLM self perception and reflection/evaluation within AI agents. In addition to the world of Natural Language Processing, I also spend my time involved in researching the application of Generative Adversarial Networks in medical image classification.

- 🧐 I am always looking for opportunities within and outside my expertise to enrich my skills and the landscape of technology.
