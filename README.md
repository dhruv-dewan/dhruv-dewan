👋 Hey There!

- 🗣️ My name is Dhruv Dewan

- 🌱 I enjoy venturing deep behind the stage curtain of AI/ML and creating practical and novel solutions. I love to learn about mathematical concepts that back these systems and backpack up large hills ⛰️.

- 🧮 Currently, I am working on creating and implementing practical fine-tuned Large Language Model pipelines for entailment based zero-shot classification applications. In addition to the world of Natural Language Processing, I spend my time involved in researching the application of Generative Adversarial Networks in image classification. I love to learn about mathematical concepts that back these systems and backpack up large hills ⛰️.

- 🧐 I am always looking for opportunities within my expertise and outside to enrich my skills and the landscape of technology.
